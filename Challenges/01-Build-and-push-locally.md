# Challenge 1: Build and push Microservice Images locally

[Previous Challenge](./00-Getting-started.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - **[Next Challenge](./02-Azure-Container-Apps.md)**

## Introduction

In this Repository we have provided the code for the example application for an airline booking service as described in [Challenge 0](./00-Getting-started.md).
To later be able to deploy them in Container Apps we first have to build images of each microservice via docker and push them to our Azure Container Registry.

## Challenge

* Clone subdirectory Flightbooker and push into personal repository
* Create docker images of the microservices
* Push the images to your ACR

## Success Criteria

* Application runs locally
* Images are pushed to the ACR
* Images can be pulled from the ACR

## Learning Resources
* [Push to Container Registries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-docker-cli?tabs=azure-cli)
