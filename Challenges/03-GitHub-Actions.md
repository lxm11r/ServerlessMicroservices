# Challenge 3: Deploy Microservices to Azure Container Apps via GitHub Actions

[Previous Challenge](./02-Azure-Container-Apps.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - **[Next Challenge](./04-FrontDoor.md)**

## Introduction

Our application is now running on Azure, which is great, but we can still use some tools to optimize it.
So far if we'd make any changes to the source code we would have to build the application locally, create a new image, push it to the Container Registry and creating a Revision of the subject Container App manually. To enhance this process we can use GitHub Actions to automate the build and deploy process.<br>
GitHub Actions is designed to help simplify workflows with flexible automation and offer easy-to-use CI/CD capabilities. Building a workflow pipeline with GitHub Actions will make the deployment more efficient and it's possible to automate everything within the GitHub repositories. 

## Challenge
* Configure GitHub actions to connect to Azure
* Add Action Secrets to GitHub Repository
* Create a build pipeline for frontend and backend that creates an Image of your code and pushes it to the ACR whenever there is a new commit pushed. Basically automate what you've done  in Challenge 1.
* Create a deploy pipeline for frontend and backend that deploys the app to the production environment, automating what you've done manually in Challenge 2.

## Success Criteria
* GitHub actions is connected to Azure
* Credentials created for Azure
* Credentials created for Azure Container Registry
* Pushing a commit to the GitHub repository automatically trigger the GitHub actions build pipeline
* New builds are pushed to the ACR and deployed to Container Apps automatically
* Triggered Workflows can be followed in the live logs.
