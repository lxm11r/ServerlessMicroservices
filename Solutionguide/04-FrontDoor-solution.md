[Previous Challenge Solution](03-GitHub-Actions-solution.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](05-Monitor-performance-solution.md)

## Task 1: Add Azure FrontDoor to your platform

A quickstart for setting up Azure Front Door with Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell or Bicep for your App Service you can find [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/create-front-door-portal) under the "Create a Front Door for your application" section.

## Task 2: Add Access Restriction

[Secure your Origin with Private Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/private-link) <br>

[Permit access only from Azure Front Door to Backend](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-architecture-blog/permit-access-only-from-azure-front-door-to-azure-app-service-as/ba-p/2000173)

## Task 2: Monitor your application

### Access Reports

Azure Front Door analytics reports provide a built-in and all-around view of how your Azure Front Door behaves along with associated Web Application Firewall metrics. You can also take advantage of Access Logs to do further troubleshooting and debugging.

Go to your Azure Front Door and in the navigation pane select Reports or Security under Analytics. You can choose between seven diferent dimensions:
* Traffic by domain
* Usage
* Traffic by location
* Cache
* Top url
* Top referrer
* Top user agent
After choosing the dimension, you can select different filters for a select time range, location, protocol or domains. 
To learn more about what the different dimensions tell you, look [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/standard-premium/how-to-reports).

### Metrics
Azure Front Door is integrated with Azure Monitor and has 11 metrics to help monitor Azure Front Door in real-time to track, troubleshoot, and debug issues.

From the Azure portal menu select All Resource and then your Front Door profile. <br>
Under Monitoring select Metrics and choose a metric to add. You can add filters and apply splitting to split data by different dimensions.

Select your Azure Front Door profile. In the profile, go to Monitoring, select Diagnostic Setting and select Add diagnostic setting. <br>
Enter a name for your Diagnostic setting, then select the log from FrontDoorAccessLog, FrontDoorHealthProbeLog and FrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLog. <br>
You can select destination details to "Send to Log Analytics" and save. <br>
